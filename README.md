# ♾️ Tic Tac Infinity

**Tic Tac Infinity** is a modern take on the classic Tic Tac Toe game with a **dynamic board**. Instead of a fixed or truly infinite grid, the game keeps the board size constant by **removing the oldest move once a player exceeds three active moves**.

This creates a fast‑paced and strategic experience where players must think ahead, manage move rotation, and adapt as the board evolves.
